# Google Colab Stuff

Just a collection of small Python tools/scripts I use (sometimes in Colab, sometimes locally — doesn't matter).

→ **Not** one big tool or project.  
→ Each folder = one independent tool.

### Super simple usage

```bash
# Clone once
git clone https://github.com/HAKORADev/Google-Colab-Stuff.git
cd Google-Colab-Stuff

# Pick whatever you want
cd name-of-the-tool-folder

# Install & run (most cases)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
- some tools have different ways to use, read teadme
